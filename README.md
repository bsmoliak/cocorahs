# CoCoRaHS

*My personal CoCoRaHS precipitation data and analysis*

[CoCoRaHS](https://cocorahs.org/) is an acronym for the Community Collaborative Rain, 
Hail and Snow Network. It is a community-based network of volunteers that collaborate
to measure and visualize precipitation of all kinds: rain, hail, and snow. The network
is administered by the Colorado Climate Center in partnership with local volunteers. 
It is sponsored in large part by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Daily precipitation observations are made by individuals and organizations throughout
the United States, Canada, and the Bahamas. [Maps](https://cocorahs.org/Maps/) are
available at the CoCoRaHS website.
